## Who I am

I'm Hovirix and I love homelabbing. If you want to know more about me, check my website [hovirix.site](https://hovirix.site), otherwise let's dive in!

I started homelabbing a few years ago without any real goal, and it turned out to be one of my favorite hobbies today. I spent so many hours tinkering, designing, testing, breaking, and learning that I don't even remember all the tools and stacks I'm using and why. That's why I created this documentation. It's mainly for me, but since I want to give back to the community that taught me so much, all the documentation is written for general use cases to help as many people as possible.

## Philosophy

<Info>
Each homelab is unique. You might have a specific goal, a lot or little experience, or just want to have some fun.
</Info>

My homelab is designed to be **simple**, **efficient**, and **useful**.

These docs are a resource center, not a fully-featured homelab guide (which would be huge and overwhelming). For beginners, I'll include links to resources (docs, blogs, websites) so your curiosity is satisfied without degrading the experience for more experienced users.
