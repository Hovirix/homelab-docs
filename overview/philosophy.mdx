description: "The principles and goals behind my homelab setup"
---

My homelab is built to be **simple**, **efficient**, and **useful**.

<Info>
Every homelab is different: goals, budget, time, and experience vary. Treat this documentation as a set of patterns you can adapt, not a one-size-fits-all blueprint.

## Principles

- **Keep it simple**: prefer boring, well-supported solutions over clever ones.
- **Declare everything**: everything in my homelab should be declared as code *IaC* or documented.
- **Automate what repeats**: if I do something twice, it should become a script, template, or documented runbook.
- **Document the “why”**: decisions and tradeoffs matter as much as the final configuration.
- **Secure by default**: least privilege, segmented networks where it helps, and secrets kept out of the repo.
- **Recoverability first**: backups and restore paths are more important than adding new services.

## What these docs are (and aren’t)

These pages are a **reference and resource center**, not a complete “build a homelab from scratch” guide.

- If you’re new, I’ll link to beginner-friendly resources (official docs, blogs, guides).
- If you’re experienced, the goal is to keep pages concise, actionable, and focused on decisions, configs, and runbooks.
