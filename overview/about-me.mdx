I’m Hovirix. I love homelabbing and documenting what I build. If you want to know more about me personally, you can visit my website: [hovirix.site](https://hovirix.site). Otherwise, let’s dive in.

I started homelabbing a few years ago for privacy and self-hosting. Over time it became one of my favorite hobbies. I’ve spent a lot of hours tinkering, designing, testing, breaking things, and learning often to the point where I forget *why* I made certain choices.

This documentation solves that: it’s my reference, but it’s written for anyone who wants to reuse ideas, setups, and troubleshooting steps for their own homelab.
